## What is a Forex Funded Account?

A **Forex funded account** is a trading account provided by a proprietary trading firm (prop firm) that supplies the capital, while the trader contributes the skill. Instead of risking your own money, you prove your skills via an evaluation phase. Once passed, you're given access to a large amount of capital to trade with and share profits.

> ✅ *You trade, they fund. You win, they share.*

## Why Traders Choose Funded Accounts

Traders—especially beginners—are attracted to funded accounts for several reasons:

- ✅ **No personal capital required**
- ✅ **Low risk, high potential**
- ✅ **Access to professional tools and support**
- ✅ **Scalable capital as you grow**
- ❌ *Strict evaluation phases for most firms*
- ❌ *Profit split may be less than 100%*

## Requirements to Get a Funded Account

While each firm has its own policy, typical requirements include:

- Consistent profits across 1-2 months  
- Risk management rules (e.g., no over-leveraging)
