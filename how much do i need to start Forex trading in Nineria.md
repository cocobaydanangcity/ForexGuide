## Understanding Leverage and Margin

Leverage allows you to control a large trade size with a smaller amount of money.

For example:
- 1:500 leverage means $100 can control $50,000 worth of currency.

⚠️ *High leverage = higher risk*. Use it wisely.

**Margin** is the amount required to open a trade. Keep an eye on it to avoid margin calls.

---

## Regulations and Safety in Nigeria

The Nigerian SEC has warned against unregulated Forex platforms. That’s why it’s critical to choose **regulated brokers** and ensure your capital is safe.

✅ **Only trade with brokers regulated by authorities like:**
- FCA (UK)
- ASIC (Australia)
- CySEC (Cyprus)

🔒 *Never deposit funds with unknown or unregulated companies.*
