## Understanding Leverage in Option Selling

Leverage allows traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. In option selling, leverage can magnify both potential profits and losses. It's essential to comprehend how leverage works:

- **Leverage Ratio:** Expressed as a ratio (e.g., 1:100), it indicates how much larger the position is compared to the margin required.
- **Margin Requirement:** The amount of capital a trader must deposit to open a leveraged position.
- **Risk Implications:** Higher leverage increases the potential for significant gains but also exposes traders to substantial losses.
