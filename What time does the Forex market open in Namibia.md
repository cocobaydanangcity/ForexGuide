## Understanding the Global Forex Market

The **Foreign Exchange Market (Forex)** is a decentralized, over-the-counter market where currencies are traded. With a daily trading volume exceeding $7 trillion, it is the most liquid financial market globally.

Forex is open **24 hours a day, five days a week**, due to the overlapping trading sessions across global financial centers. However, the timing of these sessions varies depending on your geographic location.

✅ *Key insight:* The Forex market is not tied to a physical exchange but operates globally through banks, institutions, and retail brokers.
