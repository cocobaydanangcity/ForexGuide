## What is Forex Trading?

**Forex** (foreign exchange) trading is the process of buying and selling currency pairs to profit from changes in exchange rates. Unlike the stock market, **Forex operates 24 hours a day, five days a week**, offering global access.

*Over $7.5 trillion is traded daily on the Forex market.*

Forex trading involves trading pairs like **EUR/USD**, **GBP/JPY**, or **AUD/NZD**, where one currency is exchanged for another. Your goal is to **buy low and sell high** (or vice versa).

---

## Why Trade Forex?

✅ **High Liquidity** – Trade whenever you want with ease.  
✅ **Low Barrier to Entry** – Open an account with as little as $10.  
✅ **Leverage Opportunities** – Boost your buying power.  
✅ **Profit from Rising or Falling Markets** – Go long or short.  
✅ **Freedom & Flexibility** – Work from anywhere, anytime.

---

## How the Forex Market Works

The Forex market is decentralized and operates over-the-counter (OTC). Major participants include:

- Central Banks  
- Commercial Banks  
- Hedge Funds  
- Retail Traders (like you!)

*Forex trading is affected by global events, economic data, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical tension.*

Currencies are quoted in **pairs**, where the first currency is the base and the second is the quote. For example:

- **EUR/USD = 1.1000** means 1 Euro = 1.10 US Dollars.

---

## Key Terms Every Beginner Must Know

Here are some **essential Forex terms**:

- **Pip:** Smallest price movement.  
- **Leverage:** Borrowed capital to increase returns.  
- **Margin:** Minimum deposit to open a position.  
- **Spread:** Difference between bid and ask price.  
- **Lot Size:** Volume of your trade.  
- **Stop Loss / Take Profit:** Tools to manage risk.

*Mastering these terms is crucial to long-term trading success.*

---

## Types of Forex Brokers

There are two main types of brokers:

1. **Market Makers** – Provide liquidity and set their own prices.  
2. **ECN/STP Brokers** – Direct market access and tighter spreads.

*Choose a broker based on your trading style, budget, and execution speed.*
