## Introduction to Forex Trading

Forex (foreign exchange) trading is the process of buying and selling currencies to make a profit. It is the **largest financial market in the world**, with a daily turnover exceeding $7 trillion. If you've ever exchanged one currency for another, you've participated in the Forex market.

For beginners, *understanding how Forex works is the first step* toward financial independence and global market access.

## How the Forex Market Works

The Forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, and is decentralized — meaning there is no central exchange. Instead, trading is done over-the-counter (OTC) via brokers or banks.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Major currency pairs**: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, etc.
- **Leverage**: Traders can control large positions with small capital
- **Liquidity**: Very high — traders can enter/exit trades instantly

✅ *High liquidity and 24/5 accessibility make Forex suitable for all traders, especially beginners.*

## Key Concepts Every Beginner Must Know

Before diving into trading, it's crucial to understand these terms:

### 1. **Currency Pair**
Always traded in pairs, e.g., EUR/USD. The first is the base currency; the second is the quote currency.

### 2. **Pip**
The smallest price move in a currency pair, usually 0.0001.

### 3. **Leverage**
Using borrowed funds from a broker to trade larger volumes. While leverage can magnify profits, it also increases risk. ❌ *Beginners should avoid high leverage until they're experienced.*

### 4. **Spread**
The difference between the buying (ask) and selling (bid) prices.

### 5. **Lot Size**
Standard lot = 100,000 units; mini lot = 10,000 units; micro lot = 1,000 units.

## Step-by-Step: How to Start Forex Trading

### 1. **Choose a Reliable Broker**
Choose a regulated broker that offers demo accounts, user-friendly platforms, and beginner support (more on this later).

### 2. **Create a Trading Account**
Most brokers offer two types:
- **Demo Account** (practice)
- **Live Account** (real money)

✅ *Start with a demo account before risking real money.*

### 3. **Fund Your Account**
Use bank transfers, e-wallets, or crypto to fund your account.

### 4. **Learn and Apply Analysis**
- **Technical Analysis**: Charts, indicators, trends
- **Fundamental Analysis**: News, economic reports

### 5. **Develop a Trading Plan**
Set risk levels, entry/exit points, and trading goals.

### 6. **Start Small, Scale Slowly**
Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss and take-profit tools.
