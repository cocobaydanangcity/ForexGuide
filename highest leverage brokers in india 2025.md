## Understanding Leverage in Forex Trading

Leverage in forex trading allows traders to control a larger position than their initial capital would otherwise permit. For instance, with a leverage of 1:100, a trader can control a position worth ‚Çπ100,000 with just ‚Çπ1,000. While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases the potential for significant losses. Therefore, it's essential to use leverage judiciously and implement effective risk management strategies.
