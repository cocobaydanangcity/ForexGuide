## What Is Unlimited Leverage in Forex Trading?

**Unlimited leverage** refers to the ability to trade without a specific cap on the ratio between the trader's capital and the position size. For instance, a 1:∞ leverage lets you open positions of any size regardless of your balance (within certain conditions).

**Example:**
- Deposit: $10
- With 1:Unlimited leverage → You could potentially open a $100,000 position

**Key terms:**
- *Margin* – The minimum equity required to open a position
- *Equity* – Your real-time account value
- *Free margin* – Available funds for new positions

✅ **Pro Tip**: Unlimited leverage often kicks in only when your balance is below a certain threshold (e.g., $999).
