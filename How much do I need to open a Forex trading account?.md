### Understanding Forex Account Costs

Before we explore numbers, let’s clarify what goes into the **cost of opening and maintaining a Forex trading account**:

- **Initial deposit** (minimum funding requirement)
- **Spreads and commissions**
- **Swap/rollover fees**
- **Inactivity or withdrawal fees** (depending on broker)

You don’t always need thousands of dollars to begin. In fact, several reputable brokers now offer **minimum deposits starting from just $1 to $10**. ✅

But is starting small always the best approach? Let’s dig deeper.

- **Spread**: The difference between buy/sell price
- **Commission**: Charged on some ECN accounts
- **Swap Fees**: Charged for holding positions overnight
