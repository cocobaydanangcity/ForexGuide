## What is Forex Trading?
Forex (foreign exchange) trading is the **global marketplace for buying and selling currencies**. It’s the largest financial market in the world, operating 24/5 and offering opportunities for traders to speculate on the value of different currencies.

*Fun Fact: Over $7.5 trillion is traded daily in the forex market!*

Forex trading involves speculating on the price movement of currency pairs, such as **EUR/USD**, **GBP/JPY**, or **USD/ZAR**. You make a profit when the market moves in your favor. Unlike stock trading, where you own the asset, in forex you are trading on price fluctuations using leverage.

**Key Benefits of Forex Trading:**
- Access to a global market from your phone or laptop
- Trades available 24 hours a day, five days a week
- Leverage lets you control large positions with a small amount
- Low entry capital required

> ✅ *Forex is ideal for people looking to supplement their income or build a new career path entirely from home.*

## Is Forex Trading Legal in Malawi?

## How Forex Works: The Basics
Forex trading is always done in pairs. For example, when you trade the EUR/USD, you're speculating on the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. If you think the euro will rise against the dollar, you buy. If you think it will fall, you sell.

The basic concept is:
- **Buy low, sell high** if you expect the currency to appreciate
- **Sell high, buy back lower** if you expect depreciation

**Example:**
If EUR/USD is at 1.1000 and you buy, then it moves to 1.1100, you’ve made a profit of 100 pips.
