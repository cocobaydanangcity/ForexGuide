## Introduction

For aspiring traders who want to access large capital without risking their own money, **getting a funded Forex account** can be a game changer. The Forex industry has evolved significantly over the past decade, introducing a wide range of proprietary trading firms and brokers offering capital to skilled traders. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about funded accounts, from eligibility requirements to broker reviews, and actionable steps to help you secure one.

## What is a Funded Forex Account?

A *funded Forex account* is an account provided by a proprietary trading firm or broker, where the trader is allowed to trade with the firm's capital instead of their own. In return, the trader shares a percentage of the profit with the firm, usually around 70–90% in favor of the trader. ✅ This model allows skilled traders to scale their strategies without initial financial pressure.
