## What is Forex Trading?

**Forex trading**, also known as foreign exchange or FX trading, is the process of buying and selling currencies to profit from their price changes. It’s the largest financial market in the world with over **$7 trillion USD traded daily** 🌎.

In simple terms, you're trading currency pairs like:
