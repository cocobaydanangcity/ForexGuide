## Introduction to Forex Trading

Forex trading, or foreign exchange trading, involves buying and selling currencies to make a profit. It’s one of the largest and most liquid financial markets in the world, with over $6 trillion traded daily. For those who are new to trading, it might sound daunting at first, but understanding the basics and developing a disciplined approach can make all the difference.

For beginners, starting with a small amount of capital—such as $100—can be a great way to test the waters without risking too much. In this article, we’ll break down the steps, tools, and techniques you need to start trading Forex with just $100.

## What You Need to Know Before Trading Forex

Before you dive into Forex trading, it's important to familiarize yourself with several key concepts:

- **Forex Pairs**: The most fundamental element of Forex trading is currency pairs. These pairs represent the relationship between two currencies, such as EUR/USD (Euro/US Dollar).
- **Bid and Ask Price**: The bid price is the amount you will receive if you sell the currency pair, while the ask price is the amount you will pay if you buy the currency pair.
- **Pips**: A "pip" is a unit of measurement for currency movements, typically the fourth decimal place in a currency pair.
- **Lot Sizes**: Forex traders typically trade in standard, mini, or micro lots. A standard lot represents 100,000 units of the base currency, a mini lot represents 10,000, and a micro lot represents 1,000 units.

Knowing these terms and understanding how the market works is crucial before you start.

2. **Fund Your Account**: Deposit $100 into your trading account using an available payment method (bank transfer, credit card, or e-wallet).
3. **Verify Your Account**: Most brokers require identity verification. You may need to submit a copy of your ID and a proof of address.

## Understanding Leverage and Margin

One of the key concepts in Forex trading is leverage. Leverage allows you to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. For example, if your broker offers 1:100 leverage, you can control $10,000 with just $100.

While leverage can amplify your profits, it also increases the risk of losses. It's crucial to understand how leverage works and use it responsibly, especially when trading with a small capital.

### Example:
If you use 1:100 leverage and your position moves 1% in your favor, you could make $100 profit on a $100 investment. However, if the market moves against you by 1%, you could lose your entire $100.

## Risk Management: Protecting Your $100

When trading with a small account balance, **risk management** is essential to ensure you don’t blow your account. Here are a few tips to protect your $100:

1. **Use Stop-Loss Orders**: Always set a stop-loss order to limit your potential losses.
2. **Trade Small Lot Sizes**: Avoid overexposing yourself to large positions when you’re starting with a small account.
3. **Risk Only 1-2% Per Trade**: A common rule is to risk no more than 1-2% of your capital on any single trade.

By practicing good risk management, you can prevent significant losses and grow your capital over time.

---

## Starting with Demo Accounts

Many brokers offer demo accounts, which allow you to practice trading with virtual funds. This is a great way to get comfortable with the trading platform, learn how to place orders, and test your strategies without risking real money.

Make sure to spend plenty of time on a demo account before trading with real money. This will help you build confidence and avoid costly mistakes when you start trading with your $100.

## Developing a Forex Trading Strategy

Developing a trading strategy is essential for long-term success. As a beginner with just $100, your strategy should focus on low-risk trades and small, consistent profits.

### Key Components of a Trading Strategy:
- **Technical Analysis**: Use chart patterns, indicators, and trend analysis to identify potential trade setups.
- **Fundamental Analysis**: Keep an eye on economic news, interest rates, and geopolitical events that affect currency prices.
- **Trading Plan**: Set clear rules for entering and exiting trades. Stick to your plan and avoid emotional trading.
